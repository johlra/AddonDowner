##AddonDowner instructions

The app has one main window that displays a table of all add ons you have added to it.

First time start you should start with adding path to your wow addon dir (mine on the mac is "/Applications/World of Warcraft/Interface/AddOns") and fill in the wow launcher path (mine is "/Applications/World of Warcraft/World of Warcraft Launcher.app").

Then you can look at the checkboxes.   
If "Auto update on launch" is checked the app will direct on start do a check for and do update on all addons in the table.    
If "Quit after update" is checked the app will quit itself after all addons are updated.    
If "Auto start WOW launcher" is checked the app will start what's in the field "WOW Launcher" direct on start of app, so if wow have something that needs to be downloaded it will do it at the same time as addons will be updated.   

Then we have 3 buttons, "Launcher" will start what's in "WOW launcher", "Update" will run the update of all addons and the last button "Add" will open a dialog that ask for name and url.    
Name is for you, so you easy can see which addon it is. URL is the download url.        
As for the first alpha version we have support for curse addons urls and elvui from tukui (that url will always be http://www.tukui.org/dl.php). Curse url is taken from each curse addons download button, like on the page "http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/deadly-boss-mods" you can right click on the "Download" button and get the link "http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/deadly-boss-mods/download" in your clipboard and you can paste it into the app.

Good luck!
